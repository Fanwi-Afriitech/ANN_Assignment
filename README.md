This document outlines the steps to implement and evaluate a neural network model for classifying species in the Iris dataset. The script demonstrates how to train a neural network using different hidden layer configurations and assess their accuracy. The Iris dataset is used for this purpose, and the neural network is built using the neuralnet package in R.
